Project 3
Percy Dragon

I'm considering making a creative interactive space
using various techniques we learned in class
I might use the switch state that michael showed me to switch between
concepts
so i'll have the moving planets from proto1
the nebula from proto2
and im considering intergratting collision + arrays in this version as well
all using OOP to get myself familizarized with it
